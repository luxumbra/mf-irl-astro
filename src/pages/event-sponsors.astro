      After doing [a conference](https://metagame.substack.com/p/intercon-what-how-even), [a
      hackathon](https://metagame.substack.com/p/fork-the-world-opening-), two MetaFests
      ([1](https://metagame.substack.com/p/metaspecial-metafest-is-alive) &
      [2](https://metagame.substack.com/p/metafest2-is-happening-now)) & countless meetups all in the metaverse, we‚Äôve
      decided to level up & organize IRL!
    </Markdown>

    <Markdown>
      [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf) is an EVM based coordination game kickstarted by MetaCartel. A decentralized
      factory & a [network of projects](https://metagame.wtf/guilds) currently concerned with onboarding people into the
      DAO space.

    <p>About Croatia:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Beautiful & Fairly cheap</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Good tax laws & ease of doing business</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Digital nomad friendly visas</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Solid infrastructure & high safety</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Functional but corrupt states, small enough to influence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With a need for financial transparency & better governance tech, there is high potential for Web3 adoption at the
      local as well as the state level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great time-zone compatibility & good educational system combined with relatively low standards of living also make
      the Balkans a great place to hire from.

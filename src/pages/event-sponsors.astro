      After doing [a conference](https://metagame.substack.com/p/intercon-what-how-even), [a
      hackathon](https://metagame.substack.com/p/fork-the-world-opening-), two MetaFests
      ([1](https://metagame.substack.com/p/metaspecial-metafest-is-alive) &
      [2](https://metagame.substack.com/p/metafest2-is-happening-now)) & countless meetups all in the metaverse, we‚Äôve
      decided to level up & organize IRL!
    </Markdown>

    <Markdown>
      [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf) is an EVM based coordination game kickstarted by MetaCartel. A decentralized
      factory & a [network of projects](https://metagame.wtf/guilds) currently concerned with onboarding people into the
      DAO space.

  <SponsorsSection title="Why the Balkans, why Croatia?">
    <p>
      Despite proclivity towards self-organization due to a distrust of the state system & privatizing profiteers, DAO
      presence in the Balkans is weak.
    </p>
    <p>About Croatia:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Beautiful & Fairly cheap</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Good tax laws (no tax if you hodl 2+ years)</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Digital nomad friendly visas</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Solid infrastructure & high safety</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Functional but corrupt states, small enough to influence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With a need for financial transparency & better governance tech, there is high potential for Web3 adoption at the
      local as well as the state level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great time-zone compatibility & good educational system combined with relatively low standards of living also make
      the Balkans a great place to hire from.
    </p>
  </SponsorsSection>

  <SponsorsSection title="Who is it for?">
    <p>
      Attendees will mostly be people from the EVM DAO & ReFi ecosystems but mixed in with the wider regenerative,
      self-organization & Game B/Metamodern space.
    </p>

    <p>Overall, we are aiming for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" /> ~70% EVM DAOists & Regens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" /> ~15% wider non-crypto-but-adjacent spaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" /> ~15% select locals, from the tech uni, a youth DAO etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Having an epic time while exchanging cutting edge DAO/regen/meta
        knowledge & usecases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" />Inspiring more people to join the space, start local DAOs &/or
        implement Web3 tech at the local, municipal or state level.
      </li>
    </ul>

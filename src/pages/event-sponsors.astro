  <SponsorsSection title="Who‚Äôs behind it?" precis="MetaFest IRL is being summoned by MetaGame.">
    <p>
      After organizing a conference, a hackathon, two MetaFests & countless meetups all in the metaverse over the past 3
      years, we‚Äôve decided to take it up a notch & organize MetaFest IRL!
    </p>

    <p>
      MetaGame is an EVM based coordination game & a DAO, kickstarted by MetaCartel and in close ties with projects such
      as DAOhaus, MetaFactory, Raid Guild etc. - there‚Äôs actually a whole network of loosely related projects.
    </p>
  </SponsorsSection>

  <SponsorsSection title="Why the balkans?">
    <p>
      Regardless of their proclivity towards social coordination because of its history (ex-Yugoslavia countries) & a
      distrust of the state system (which is more than slightly corrupt in most), the DAO presence in the balkans is
      weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who get past the ‚Äúwhat coin should I buy‚Äù stage of crypto curiosity, generally end up working for
      alt-L1 protocols that offer the best money to effort ratio, eg. Near, Cardano & Polkadot. Time to change that.
    </p>
  </SponsorsSection>

  <SponsorsSection title="Why Croatia?">
    <p>A few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><Icon name="uim:scenery" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Beautiful</li>
      <li><Icon name="mdi:piggy-bank" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Fairly cheap</li>
      <li><Icon name="codicon:law" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Good tax laws (no tax if you hodl 2+ years)</li>
      <li><Icon name="mdi:passport-biometric" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Digital nomad friendly visas</li>
      <li><Icon name="ic:round-location-city" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Solid infrastructure & high safety</li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ri:government-fill" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Functional yet corrupt & bureacratic states, small
        enough to influence & disrupt with great tech
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="carbon:chart-population" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />Population that‚Äôs naturally inclined to local
        governance (known in our space as DAOs)
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="fa-solid:laptop-house" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />
        Overall a great place to nomad around as well as a place that could benefit from implementing crypto tech both at
        the local as well as the state level, with the high need of financial transparency & better governance technology
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="mdi:timezone-outline" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />
        Also, great timezone compatibility, a good educational system (everybody speaks English & there are blockchain courses
        at the local tech uni) as well as a relatively low standard of living make balkans a great place to hire from üôÉ
      </li>
    </ul>
  </SponsorsSection>

  <SponsorsSection title="Who is it for?">
    <p>Attendees would still mostly be people from the Ethereum/EVM DAO & regen ecosystems, from outside of Croatia.</p>
    <p>
      They will all have an absolutely amazing time getting deep into DAOs & regen topics on the fort as well as having
      a blast in activities in the surrounding area.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will attempt to raise the funds necessary from as many different DAOs & regen projects in the Ethereum/EVM space
      so that we don‚Äôt have to promote projects such as Near or Cardano.
    </p>

    <p>Please don‚Äôt disappoint us.</p>

    <h3>Wait a minute‚Ä¶</h3>
    <p>
      Seems like there was this whole spiel about why Croatia is a great place for DAOs, but now it sounds like I‚Äôm just
      offering a great time for you, fellow DAOists from outside Croatia‚Ä¶
    </p>

    <p>Not quite!</p>

    <p>
      The point is, Croatia is a great place for crypto adoption, but also, don‚Äôt expect a conference swarming with
      complete DAO newbies & content being geared towards intro talks!
    </p>

    <p>Overall, we are aiming for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" /> ~300 attendees in total, mostly EVM DAOists
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />
        10-15% being the select locals, some from the local tech uni, a youth DAO & some from wider balkans region; some
        deeply & some loosely involved in the crypto space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />
        Having an epic time with fellow DAOists & regens, doing fun stuff with a lot of the people you already know, meeting
        new ones & exchanging cutting edge DAO & regen knowledge & usecases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Icon name="ic:round-check-circle-outline" class="h-auto max-w-8 w-10" />
        Inspiring & dragging in more of the balkan people to step into the decentralize governance & regen space, potentially
        helping them start local DAOs &/or implement crypto tech at the local, municipal or state level while getting covered
        by mainstream local & regional media.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sound good?</p>
    <p>Let us proceed!</p>

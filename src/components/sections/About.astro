    <p>MetaFest is a crypto conference that isnâ€™t a conference. Why? Because most people go to
      conferences not to listen to talks, but to meet like-minded people, hang out with internet
      friends & have fun. In the spirit of MetaGame, MetaFest is about much more than crypto -
      its about anything from self-improvement to world-improvement. About self-organizing &
      problem-solving.</p>
      <p>Expect talks & workshops to range on anything from DAOs & ReFi over audio & visual
      production to walking the tightrope, yoga & meditation. As opposed to normal festivals that
      you leave & wake up depressed after, we want you to leave MetaFest inspired & with clear
      goals of what you want to achieve & where you want to go.</p>

      <h2>About the festival</h2>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam tincidunt, mauris sit</p>
      <p>
        MetaFest is a crypto conference that isnâ€™t a conference. Why? Because most people go to conferences not to
        listen to talks, but to meet like-minded people, hang out with internet friends & have fun. In the spirit of
        MetaGame, MetaFest is about much more than crypto - its about anything from self-improvement to
        world-improvement. About self-organizing & problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expect talks & workshops to range on anything from DAOs & ReFi over audio & visual production to walking the
        tightrope, yoga & meditation. As opposed to normal festivals that you leave & wake up depressed after, we want
        you to leave MetaFest inspired & with clear goals of what you want to achieve & where you want to go.

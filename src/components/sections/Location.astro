        <p>We chose this epic, unique & historical location - a 200 years old
          fortress called Punta Christo, built to defend the city of Pula & the
          Austro-Hungarian empire’s massive navy feet harbored within.
          City of Pula itself; from the Neolithic era pottery indicating settlement
          between 6000-2000 BC, to pre-Christ era Roman monuments long
          outlasting the empire, such as the 2000+ years old Roman
          Amphitheatre, Augustus’ Temple & the Arch of Sergii.
          Other than the rich history, beautiful sights & good food, the area
          offer all kinds of activities, more below.</p>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto ml-[33%]">We chose this epic, unique & historical location - a 200 years old
      fortress called Punta Christo, built to defend the city of Pula & the
      Austro-Hungarian empire’s massive navy feet harbored within.
      City of Pula itself; from the Neolithic era pottery indicating settlement
      between 6000-2000 BC, to pre-Christ era Roman monuments long
      outlasting the empire, such as the 2000+ years old Roman
      Amphitheatre, Augustus’ Temple & the Arch of Sergii.
      Other than the rich history, beautiful sights & good food, the area
      offer all kinds of activities, more below.</p>

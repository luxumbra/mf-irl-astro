We leave around noon - subject to change but we need time in the morning to take care of things around the MetaFest venue.

We’ll take the old scenic roads that take ~5h. We’ll be driving windy roads through pretty small coastal towns, we’ll be breaking our trip to stop, walk, eat or whatever at random locations along the way.

In the afternoon/evening, we’ll get to [the house](https://adria-velebitica.hr/en/accommodation/lika-house-1), settle in, chill & sleep.

### Sunday 20th of August

We sleep well & decently long for the first time since the beginning of MetaFest.

Then we go rafting to lose that extra energy we just got!

Rafting is, of course, optional. There’s [a bunch of other activities](https://adria-velebitica.hr/en/team-building) we can engage in for the rest of the day at the village itself.

We cook or barbecue & chill for the rest of the day then go to sleep in the same house.

### Monday 21st of August

We leave then village, pay a quick visit to Nikola Tesla’s home/museum which is close by.

Then we go to Plitvice Lakes & spend most of the day there.

Eat etc. & go to the new house. Then plan the DAO meetup.

### Tuesday 22nd of August

We take the old road & ride down to Split. Have lunch, go to the beach or do the DAO meetup.

Yes! We’re doing a small DAO meetup in collaboration with the locals!

Spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the old town & the Diocletian’s Palace from the 4th century AD - or whatever else you decide to do.

Then we get to the third house & chill.

### Wednesday 23rd of August

We drive down to Dubrovnik. Do some sightseeing around Dubrovnik (the Game of Thrones place) & try not to get robbed (not literally, Dubrovnik is just super expensive).

In the afternoon/evening, we take the old scenic road to Montenegro & take a 1h hike up the mountain to the final house!

We spend the evening chilling, talking about the best moments from the past 2 weeks, talking about the next steps, next MetaFest & trying to not feel bad its ending. Then go to sleep tired AF.

### Thursday 24th of August

Leave the house, drop people off at Dubrovnik airport around 10am & fuck off back to Pula.

On the way back, we can stop in Split &/or Rijeka if there are people flying out of those cities or Zagreb.
